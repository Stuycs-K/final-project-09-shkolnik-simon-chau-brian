# THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED
## Group Info
Audio Stegnoraphy LLC
Brian Chau and Simon Shkolnik

## Overview
The project focuses on using Fourier Transformations in audio stegnoraphy. We encoded our secret file directly into the audio file but using Fourier Transformation, we can find the secret file. In this project we have used two different ways of encoding our message, hiding the message in inaudible frequencies and using phase shifts to hide the audio.

## Instructions
The library used in this program are:
- **numpy**: vector math
- **audiofile**: audio reading and writing
- **scipy**: signal processing
- **matplotlib**: plotting / visualising

To install requirements: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
